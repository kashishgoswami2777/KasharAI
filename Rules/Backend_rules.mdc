Follow strict folder structure: routes → services → utils → models.
Each endpoint must have a single responsibility.
Validate all incoming requests (PDF size, text length, quiz params, etc.).
Never let LLM generate backend logic without constraints.
All Agora and Supabase tokens must be generated server-side.
Log errors clearly and never suppress exceptions silently.
