# **Kashar AI – Developer Build Rules**

Concise rules to follow during development to prevent hallucination, inconsistent code, bad UI patterns, and unnecessary complexity.

---

## **UI & Design Rules**

1. **Avoid any purple or blue contrast combinations** (commonly associated with AI‑generated UI). Stick to clean, modern neutral palettes.
2. Follow consistent spacing, typography, and component patterns across the entire app.
3. Do not introduce new UI patterns without purpose reuse existing styles.

---

## **Feature Scope & Requirements**

4. **Do not build features outside the approved project scope.** No fancy animations, dashboards, or experimental add-ons.
5. Every commit must directly align with one of the core modules: Upload → Tutor → Quiz → Flashcards → Progress.
6. If unsure whether a feature is required, assume **NO** and keep it minimal.

## **AI/LLM Usage Rules**

7. Never allow LLM to auto‑decide new architectures or libraries—always stick to documented stack.
8. All LLM outputs must be validated for correctness before implementation.
9. Break tasks into smaller prompts to reduce hallucination.
10. Avoid vague instructions like "build however you want" always specify inputs, outputs, and constraints.

---

## **Security & Stability Rules**

11. Avoid exposing API keys in frontend code.
12. Follow Supabase Row Level Security for user data.
13. Ensure Agora tokens are generated server‑side only.
14. Validate PDF uploads (size limit, format) before processing.

---

## **Coding Quality Rules**

15. Use modular, predictable folder structure.
16. Keep each function small, testable, and with a single responsibility.
17. Never push code that hasn't been run locally.
18. Avoid unnecessary abstractions—simple code is better code.

---

## **Consistency Rules**

19. Maintain consistent naming conventions across frontend & backend.
20. Every feature must have a clearly defined input → process → output workflow.
21. No last‑minute changes unless they fix a proven issue.

---

## **Focus Rule (Most Important)**

22. **The goal is to finish, not over‑engineer.** Stick to required features only, avoid distractions, and keep everything minimal yet functional.
