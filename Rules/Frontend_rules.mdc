Frontend Rules (React)
Use consistent spacing, typography, and reusable components.
No unnecessary animations, gradients, or experimental UI elements.
Never store API keys or tokens in the frontend.
Keep React components modular and small.
Validate all user inputs before sending to backend.
Avoid over-engineering state management—use simple patterns (Context or minimal Redux).
