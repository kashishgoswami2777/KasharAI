Agora Rules (RTC + RTM)
Generate RTC/RTM tokens only on backend (FastAPI endpoint).
Do not create unnecessary channels—one channel per session.
For voice sessions: route audio → STT → LLM → TTS → Agora.
Ensure Agora event listeners (join/leave/error) are always implemented.
Do not mix RTC and RTM logic in the same React component.
