Database Rules (Supabase + ChromaDB)
Use Supabase Row Level Security for all user-specific tables.
Store embeddings only in Chroma, metadata only in Supabase.
Keep table structure simple: users, documents, topics, quizzes, scores, logs.
No storing raw PDFs in DB—use only parsed text or references.
Ensure all quiz attempts, tutor interactions, and progress logs are timestamped.
